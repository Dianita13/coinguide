Coinguide About Us Page

The world is fast adopting crpto-currency and a lot of tokens/coins are been traded on daily basis.
With this, there is need for a reliable and up to date platform to guide traders by giving them the necessary details and information that they need to carry on their daily trade. It was due to this necessity that Coinguide was born.

Coinguide is a web app with the aim of guiding crypto traders on the most popular Cryptocurrencies. 
This is achieved by fetching records from different cryptocurrency exchanges with the help of their api and rating these records according to their buy orders.

Coinguide also aims to keep traders informed about the popular coins. Popular coins are coins with the highest number of orders within a specific time range. 

We hope to become the most reliable platform that accurately ranks coins/tokens based on how much traders and buying a selling using a mathematical algorithms.

Note: One thing to note is that coinguide  isnâ€™t an exchange nor a website that gives investors financial advise on which coin to buy or not, but rather it simply gets the required data from crypto exchanges's api, processes the data using an algorithm and tells users the coins gaining popularity and those loosing popularity.

We wish you all the best and hope you enjoyed your stay on our site.
