## Short Summary:

COINGUIDE : a webapp that aims to guide crypto traders on the most popular Cryptocurrencies. It achieves this by fetching records from different exchanges using their API, rating these records according to their buy orders.

Coinguide aims to keep traders informed about the popular coins (coins which the highest number of buy orders within a specific time range). A future goal of the project is to become a reliable platform that accurately ranks coins/tokens based on how much traders and buying a selling using a mathematical algorithms. Coinguide isn't a website that gives investors financial advise on which coin to buy or not, it simply gets the required data from exchanges, processes the data using an algorithm and tells users the coins gaining popularity and those loosing popularity.
